# Business Analytics and Operations Intelligence

This project was initially developed as an academic assignment and later enhanced into a full project by integrating data analytics, machine learning, and visualization techniques. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how analytical methods can be applied to real-world business and operational scenarios to support informed decision-making.

The project focuses on translating data into meaningful insights rather than only building models, reflecting how analytics is used in real organizational environments.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze business and operational data to identify patterns, risks, and performance drivers that influence organizational outcomes. By combining statistical analysis, machine learning models, and visualizations, the project aims to demonstrate how data can support strategic and operational decisions across different business functions.

---

## Data and Tools

The analysis was conducted using a structured dataset sourced for academic learning purposes and processed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Data preprocessing steps were performed to ensure accuracy and consistency before applying analytical techniques.

The tools used in this project include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook.

## Analytical Approach

The project follows a structured analytical workflow starting from data understanding and preparation, followed by model development, evaluation, and interpretation. Multiple analytical techniques were applied, each aligned with a specific business use case. The focus throughout the project was on interpretability and practical relevance rather than purely technical performance.

- Which customers are at high risk of churn?
- What factors drive employee performance?
- Can product quality be predicted using operational data?
- How can customers be segmented for targeted strategies?
- Which business features truly drive success?

## Business Scenarios and Analysis

### Sales and Marketing Analysis

Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between marketing spend and sales revenue. The visualization highlights how changes in marketing investment influence sales outcomes, enabling revenue forecasting and marketing ROI evaluation.

---

### Customer Churn Prediction

Logistic regression was applied to identify customers at high risk of churn. Model outputs and evaluation metrics were visualized to support proactive customer retention strategies.

---

### Customer Segmentation

K-Means clustering was used to segment customers into distinct groups based on behavioral and demographic characteristics. These segments can be used for targeted marketing, pricing, and engagement strategies.

---

### Employee Performance Evaluation

Decision Tree and Random Forest models were used to analyze employee performance and identify key contributing factors. The analysis highlights the importance of variables such as training hours and experience while demonstrating the benefit of ensemble models for improved accuracy.

---

### Product Quality Control

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was used to classify product quality outcomes based on operational data. This analysis demonstrates how predictive analytics can support quality monitoring and risk reduction.

---

## Key Business Insights

- Marketing spend shows a strong positive relationship with sales revenue, supporting data-driven marketing investment decisions.
- Customer churn can be predicted with over 90% accuracy, enabling proactive retention strategies.
- Training hours and experience are key drivers of employee performance.
- Ensemble models significantly improve prediction accuracy over single models.
- Customer segmentation reveals clear groups for pricing and engagement strategies.
- Not all available data adds value — feature selection helps focus on metrics that truly impact business success.
